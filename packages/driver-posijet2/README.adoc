# Introduction

This module is used to control each aspect of the cmpp board. The intention is to offer a high-level interface to interact with, but also to allow fine-control if necessary.

The assincronicity is reached using _Promises_ constructs.


# Modules: 

- API
- Core-Models
- Datalink Layer
- Memory Map
- Transport Layer

Bellow bref description of how each module works

## API

Here we concentrate all public interface with the parts of this module.

## Core-Models

Base models are stored here

## Datalink Layer

It's the cmpp low-level layer. Here is contempled things like ESC+STX+ _____ +ESC+ETX+CHECKSUM. The '___' in this level is considered a uncasted payload. The payload will be dealed in higher's abstractions layers.

Datalink is a protocol implementation responsible to transmmit a _any data payload_ from point A to point B _with error detection_ (expressed through the checksum byte).

## Memory Map


Specifies what each of the cmpp memaddress position refers. For example, where is the parameter `initial position` in the memory of cmpp, and what kind of type that information is (ie: `mm`, `mm/s`, etc)

## Transport Layer

In this layer is assumed that `Datalink Layer` was garanteed to happen. It works as an higher abstraction layer.

While Datalink layer is ocupied of correctly send and receive _any data payload_ from A to B. Transport layer is responsible to interpret (cast) the payload.
