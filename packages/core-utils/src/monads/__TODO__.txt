Future:

Is under development and not is finished.
This is a substitute to js Promise

Future are lazy evaluated and 'more' pure than promise. 
It also adhere to core-utils monads api (ex: fmap method, etc) 

Reader / Writer / IO:

I think it is almost finished. But I think it's necessary to check if it is completely done.
